- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Always read the docs and options before using mix tasks by using `mix help task_name`
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
